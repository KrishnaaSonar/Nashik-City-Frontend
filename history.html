            <h3>The Ramayana Era</h3>
            <ul class="history-list">
                <li><strong>Root:</strong> The name 'Nashik' is derived from the Sanskrit word 'Nasika', meaning nose. According to the Ramayana, this is the location where Lakshmana, the brother of Lord Rama, cut off the nose of the demoness Surpanakha.</li>
                <li><strong>The Exile (Vanvas):</strong> Lord Rama, along with Sita and Lakshmana, spent a significant portion of their 14-year exile in the Dandakaranya forest, of which Nashik was a part.</li>
                <li><strong>Panchavati:</strong> This specific area in Nashik is named after the five (Panch) Banyan (Vati) trees. It served as the residence for the holy trio. These trees are still present near the Sita Gufa.</li>
                <li><strong>Tapovan:</strong> Historically a place for penance (Tapasya), this is where Lakshmana stayed and where the encounter with Surpanakha took place.</li>
                <li><strong>Sita Haran:</strong> Mythology states that the Golden Deer (Maricha) appeared here to distract Rama, leading to the eventual kidnap of Goddess Sita by Ravana from Panchavati.</li>
                <li><strong>The Godavari Origin:</strong> The river Godavari is often called the Dakshin Ganga. Believed that  Sage Gautama brought the river to earth to rid himself of the sin of killing a cow, performing tapasya at Brahmagiri hills near Nashik.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Ancient History</h3>
            <ul class="history-list">
                <li><strong>Satavahana Dynasty (200 BC):</strong> Nashik was a prosperous center under King Kanha. The Pandavleni Caves were carved during this period, showing the city's importance as a Buddhist center.</li>
                <li><strong>Mughal Period:</strong> The city was once known as 'Gulshanabad' during Mughal rule, signifying the 'City of Roses' due to its natural beauty.</li>
                <li><strong>The Peshwa Era:</strong> Nashik became a major political and religious center under the Maratha Empire. The Peshwas built the iconic Kalaram Temple and developed the various 'Ghats' along the Godavari.</li>
